# Windows Silky Principles

## 1. Report Before Cleanup

Windows workspace cleanup should start with a report. Deleting files too early creates a second problem: loss of provenance. The first patch is always visibility.

## 2. One Canonical Artifact

For every versioned EXE/MSI/MSIX/ZIP/APK/AAB/IPA group, choose one current artifact and give the rest an archive decision.

Keep:

- the current build;
- its evidence manifest;
- checksum;
- install or smoke result;
- screenshot or preview;
- release note or archive decision.

## 3. Evidence Beside Artifacts

An installer without evidence becomes a mystery object. Evidence should live near the artifact or in a predictable release evidence folder.

## 4. README Is An Entry Point

A large project without a README or project card taxes every re-entry. The first screen should answer: what is this, what works, what proof exists, what is next.

## 5. Encoding Is A Gate

Chinese copy, Markdown, JSON, HTML, JSX, TSX, and release notes should be checked before screenshots, packaging, and public publishing.

## 6. Assetize Repetition

If the same workflow appears twice, write a checklist or rule. If it appears three times and needs judgment, make it a Skill. If it blocks release, make a script or SOP.

## 7. No Unsafe System Tweaks By Default

This repository focuses on workflow smoothness. Registry, Defender, shell extension, startup item, and power plan patches need explicit user intent, evidence, and rollback steps.
